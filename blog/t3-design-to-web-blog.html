      <h3>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</h3>
        <p>
          A responsive site is one that is able to adapt from screen to screen, looking different according to the screens size. This means that the way you veiw a site on a laptop will look different to how you veiw it on a mobile phone. Responsiveness is important because it ensures a good user experiance no matter what device is being used. This is especially important today as there are so many different devices available.
        </p>
      <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h3>
        <p>
          Mobile first design is where you initally write your websites code for a mobile phone then adjust it using media queries to look the way you need it to on other devices. We do this because if you start with a desktop site then strip things down to a mobile site it would be much more difficult than slowly build the website up from mobile to desktop in media queries. It is important because it is a really good way of making sure you have a resposive site.

      <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</h3>
        <p>
           Frameworks take an already commonly used structure and then let the designer edit it to how they need for their own site, therefore not having to write it from scratch. Using frameworks can save a lot of time for web designers. However I have found that they are not always designer friendly as they can lack information on how to use the framework. In saying this though it can still be a really great way to save time.

      <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h3>
        <p>
          A wireframe is a basic drawing that is done to plan and see the layout in which you want in your website. This drawing has no pictures, colors or styles; it's just the very basic outline of the website that is then put into html and later css.
