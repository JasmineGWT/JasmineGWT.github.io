      <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>
          I found it really challenging as at school when I designed websites the end product was a big part of it. I once had a teacher give me an excellance because the actual website was nice but they said the code was crazy. Since then I've made sure to always have my code as neat as possible but I still find that I focus on the end product a bit too much so I will have to work on that. I also want to make sure I am being as efficient as possible since I know how important that is so using the system of 'process over product' will probally help me with that.

      <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
        <p>
          Even though I understood the benefits from meditation, I honestly thought of it as rather boring and not something I have the attention span for.
        </p>
      <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
        <p>
          I found it really interesting learning about 'formal' mindfullness because I have such a short attention span I have leaned towards 'informal' mindfullness and only really know about that. The difference between the two being that with 'formal' you go out of your way to make time to be mindfull where as with 'informal' its something you try to just constanly be, especially in high emotion times. Again I personally don't think I would be able to practice 'formal' mindfullness (eg. meditation) however I still find it an interesting concept.
        </p>
      <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
        <p>
          I personally have used meditation music to relax before sleeping for the last few years of my life due to sleeping problems. This has suprisingly dramatically changed my sleeping for the better.
