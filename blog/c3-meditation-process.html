      <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>
          I found it really challenging as at school when I designed websites the end product was a big part of it. I once had a teacher give me an excellance because the actual website was nice but they said the code was crazy. Since then I've made sure to always have my code as neat as possible but I still find that I focus on the end product a bit too much so I will have to work on that. I also want to make sure I am being as efficient as possible since I know how important that is so using the system of 'process over product' will probally help me with that.
