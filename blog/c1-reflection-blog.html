    <h1>Reflection on video</h1>
    <h2>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>

    <p>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
      It seems to be new, intesting, hard, kinda scary and but overall really exciting! It got me even more pumped about not just finish this course but the process getting there!
    </p>

    <p>What are your impressions?
      Shereed's words on how we are all as unexperianced as eachother was very calming which makes me hopeful that I can keep this mind set throughout the whole course. It also made me yet again realize just how student focused EDA is in terms of wanting us not only to learn but to really enjoy the learning and not get overwhelmed! Its amazing that they are able to have that as a value in education and actually uphold it since a lot of the time in education its very hard to keep students in a good mind throughout. This is very unique in my opinion.
    </p>

    <p>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
      I think its so inspiring which makes me hope I'll engage in the best ways possible. For example really appreciating the unique outlook and values in which EDA has.
    </p>

    <p>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
      Yes. They have gone back to the way they were when I was first accepted to EDA, before all the nerves came into play. It has helped me to calm down and realize that I am capible of doing this course. Along with this it has reassured me that if at any point I loose this mind set that I will be able to ask a staff member of EDA for support with getting back to this place.
    </p>

    <p>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
      If you've read my previous answers you will already know the answer to that question, YES AND YES!
