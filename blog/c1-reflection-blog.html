    <h1>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>

    <p>
      EDA seems to be a new, interesting, hard, kinda scary and but overall really exciting experience! Shereef's words on how we are all as inexperienced as each other was very calming which makes me hopeful that I can keep this mind set throughout the whole course.

    <p>
      It also made me yet again realise just how student focused EDA is in terms of wanting us not only to learn but to really enjoy the learning! My expectations have gone back to the way they were when I was first accepted to EDA, before all the nerves came into play. It has helped me to calm down and realise that I am capable of doing this course. Along with this it has reassured me that if at any point I loose this mind set that I will be able to ask a staff member of EDA for support with getting back to this place.
