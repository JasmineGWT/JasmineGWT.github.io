      <h3>Triggers when programming</h3>
        <p>
          I think for me one of my favorite parts of programming are the "Shit, I have no idea what I'm doing" moments because when you figure it out the feeling is awesome. So although I hate getting stuck I also love getting unstuck. Along with that though, a big thing I find difficult is when I have done a task and its finished and works but its not amazing. Like when I know I can improve on it but I also know that it makes no difference in terms of how the user would interact with it and it makes me not efficient since I'm spending so much time perfecting things when I could be doing other tasks. That really kills me a little bit inside.

      <h3>Siberian North Railroad</h3>
        <p>
          I get told to do this so often it's painful. I'm an extreemly impulsive person so I react on the current emotions instead of thinking things through. A lot of the time this can be really awesome and fun. For example impulsivally getting a piercing done. However, this can also be really bad sometimes because it can cause a situation in which looking back was something I could have done differently. For example deciding to go on a trip and then realizing that I have no money and that my mum has no idea where I am. Both of these things are from personal experiance. The whole 'looking back' thing is really important as well because looking back the piercing was a great idea and I still love it. Getting stuck down south for a week was not such a good idea. So how could I of avoided that situation?? Stop, notice, breath etc. I think if I had done that I would of realized how stupid it was but instead I just did it and went. I REALLY NEED TO START DOING THIS!!!
