      <h3>Times I solved problems</h3>
        <p>
          One fo the most PAINFUL things you will find with any coding is when you have an issue in your code and you can't figure out what the issue is. 9 times out of 10 its something really small and hard to spot, for example a comma in the wrong place. I have found four things that really help when trying find the issue. Lets use an example of a simple code that asks the users name and age.
        </p>

          <img src="https://scontent.fakl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14265033_927741667332583_4947980357519143720_n.jpg?oh=0399881d2d29f66d13a496b77035f20c&oe=588169FE" alt="Example of bad code">

        <p>
          1) Code validators are a must and really helpful for finding if there are any errors and if so exactly where an error is. Put your code through a validator everytime you write any code. In this case the error is on 'line 3' and the error is 'Unexpected token ILLEGAL'. This is jargon that is often hard to understand, I would google the error message as a next step. Also I have found that if it says error in 'line 9' for example, half of the time the issue is actually in 'line 8' but it's effecting 'line 9'. So I'd say look for the error three lines above and three lines below where said error is.
        </p>
        <p>
          2) Google is your bestfriend because the chances of you having the same issue as someone else is very high and its even higher when using really simple code like we are at this level. Just look at the error message and google what it means then go from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          3) WALK AWAY FROM THE COMPUTOR! If you've been staring at an issue for hours and still haven't fixed it walk away for a while and hopefully when you come back with fresh eyes you'll figure it out really quickly and feel like an idiot for taking so long. This has happened to me way to many times. It's a bittersweet feeling of 'Omg I figured it out!' and 'How did this take so long?!'.
        </p>
        <p>
          4) Practice. Unfortunatly practice has been the most helpful thing for me in terms of finding errors. I am still totally blown away by anyone doing EDA with little to no previous experiance because this is a really fast paced course and I know for a fact I would have strugled so much if I had enrolled 3 years ago before studying code at school. Without this previous knowlage I wouldn't know how to stay so calm while trying to solve issues, how to find the issues, when to know to give it a rest etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back to our example, if you have used all these steps to try and find the error, you would have most likely found that there was a missing quotation mark infront of the exclamtion mark on line 3. When added and put back through thr validator, it should look like this.

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <p>
          .map() - This is when you take the data or information from an array, do something to it and then return a new array with new data. This does not effect the origional array.
        </p>
        <p>
          .filter() - This is when you 'filter' out certain data from an array and return a new array with only the data you wanted from the orional array. For example if you have an array [3,55,6,43,78,1] and you filter out every number over 50 the new array would be [3,6,43,1].
        </p>
        <p>
          .reduce() - This is when you take an array and 'reduce' it all into one element. So with numbers it would take [3,5,6,4] and return their sum, [18]. With text it would take ["Hello","I'm","Jasmine"] and return ["HelloI'mJasmine"].
