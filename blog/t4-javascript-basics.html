      <h3>HTML/CSS and JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        Each of these all do different things to have the outcome of a well structured, visually pleasing and interactive website. HTML is used to add all the information of the website. Eg. The text, headings, nav bar. CSS is used to make all the elements in the HTML look a certain way. Eg. Image size, font, background. JavaScript is used to create the interactive aspect of a website. Eg. Inputing information to be used by the website.
      </p>
      <h3>Control flow and loops</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow is a very important part of programming because it allows the code to do different things depending on the scenario. For example lets say we needed to figure out what to wear. If its a formal event then a formal outfit is needed, for the beach you would want a swimsuit, to sit and binge watch Netflix you'd want something comfy etc. This is how the control flow works. We take the 'outfit' variable and choose the correct outcome for the nessisary event.
      </p>
      <p>
        A loop could be when you have to go shopping for new clothes. You find clothes, try them on, if you like them then you buy them otherwise you put it back, then you start again (or loop) to find more things to try on. We keep doing this until we have brought the amount of clothes we wanted or until the right outfit is found. Same goes for loops in JavaScript. We perform an action a certain amount of times or do it until the task is finished.
      </p>
      <h3>Arrays and object literals</h3>
      <p>
        Both Arrays and Objects have information stored in them, however they are stored and accessed in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays are like ordered lists. These lists contain many different things (eg. numbers, text) and they are all ordered starting from the first item to the last. The first item is item 0, meaning the fifth item is technacally item 4 which can be confusing at first. They way we acces this information is arrayName[0], having the item you want in the sqaure brackets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects however are not ordered and all the information relates to what it is. For example if we have an object called 'human'. Inside of that we have anything that would be attatched to a human eg name, age, weight. The way we acces that information is either human.information (Eg. human.age, human.name) or human["information"] (Eg. human["age"]).
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are parts of the code that we can call and use many times instead of rewriting the code all over again. They are really important in order to be efficient since it cuts down on coding time.
