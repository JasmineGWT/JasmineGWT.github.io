      <h3>Pleasure, Passion and Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          I am a bit of a 'pleasure' junkie and this becomes a really big problem at times. I find the feeling of bordem almost painful so I constantly seek out the next new and exciting thing. The reason this becomes an issue is because as said in the book, it's really hard to maintain in a stable lifestyle. For the majority of years in my life my lifestyle has been anything but stable. I have moved from place to place, seen my parents partners come and go, had a lot of wealth and also barley any etc. I've had really intense highs and even more intense lows in my life that is not exactly 'normal' for someone my age to have experianced. However, now I do have a stable life and this is something that I've always dreamed about but now I've got it I feel as if I'm constantly looking for something new to happen. I find rouiteen and normalcy boring and pretty hard to cope with. Long story short, my life has come to 'homeostasis' and I for some reason try to unbalance this by finding as many highs as I can which always brings lows with it. I am seriously working hard on this since it has become an extreemly difficult part of my life.
        </p>
      <h3>Core Values</h3>
        <p>
          I have thought about this heaps recently because I think that to a certain extent you should consider your values before doing anything. What I mean by that is if you consider values before your actions you may be suprised how you react. For example (seriously, this is a hypothetical example!): Imagine if you were thinking about a friendship you have. Am I going to be friends with this person? They're really nice to me, make me laugh and I enjoy being around them. Also they do some things that align with my core values; they work hard, they enjoy having a good time and they don't let others opinions effect them too much. However, they don't agree with some of my core values. They're racist, mean to my other friends and they take the whole 'having a good time' thing a bit too far sometimes. You need to think here whats important to you, which values you are going to follow.
        </p>
      <h4>To name a few of my own core values:</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respect others</li>
            <li>Be non-judgemental, you do you boo</li>
            <li>Never hurt anyone unless it's self defence</li>
            <li>Be chill af</li>
            <li>Try not to care too much about others opinions of me</li>
          </ul>
          Seriously, there's probally another hundred of them but most of them seem pretty obvious in terms of being a normal-ish member of society.
