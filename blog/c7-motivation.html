      <h3>Core Values</h3>
        <p>
          I have thought about this heaps recently because I think that to a certain extent you should consider your values before doing anything. What I mean by that is if you consider values before your actions you may be suprised how you react. For example (seriously, this is a hypothetical example!): Imagine if you were thinking about a friendship you have. Am I going to be friends with this person? They're really nice to me, make me laugh and I enjoy being around them. Also they do some things that align with my core values; they work hard, they enjoy having a good time and they don't let others opinions effect them too much. However, they don't agree with some of my core values. They're racist, mean to my other friends and they take the whole 'having a good time' thing a bit too far sometimes. You need to think here whats important to you, which values you are going to follow.
        </p>
      <h4>To name a few of my own core values:</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respect others</li>
            <li>Be non-judgemental, you do you boo</li>
            <li>Never hurt anyone unless it's self defence</li>
            <li>Be chill af</li>
            <li>Try not to care too much about others opinions of me</li>
          </ul>
          Seriously, there's probally another hundred of them but most of them seem pretty obvious in terms of being a normal-ish member of society.
