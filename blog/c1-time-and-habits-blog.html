    <h1>Reflection on time and habits</h1>

    <p><h3>Which time and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      I personally have put a lot of time into mindfulness in recent months due to health problems so I am very familiar with many of the techniques to achieve this. I am also going to try my best to use the habit changing techniques to improve my eating, sleeping and work patterns as they have recently become very random which decreases my ability to get stuff done.

    <p><h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      I found the 'Lizard Brain' terminology interesting as I've had a similar thing explained to me using the phrase "The annoying monkey at the back of your head". The way the monkey works is that by personifying our emotions it gives us the ability to treat them like a person. For example, imagine the ‘Monkey' is saying things such as "You're useless. There is no way you can make a website using html and CSS. Stop pretending you're smarter than you are!" You can now just tell the 'Monkey' to shut up because you know you are 100% capable of making a website and that you would be wasting your time listening to it. I’ve always found this an interesting technique to use when you're getting yourself down.

    <p><h3>What worked for you?</h3>
      For me being a heavy smoker I am trying to teach myself to use those 5 minutes for a quick break to 'Check In' with myself. By this I mean using some mindfulness techniques so when I'm finished I can go back to the rest of my day hopefully feeling calm and I hate this saying but 'in touch with my emotions'.

    </p>

    <p><h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      Most definitely the habit changing ones so I can try and get a routine going in my life. I would also be keen to try yoga again since I used to enjoy but I haven't done it for the last year.
