    <h1>Time and habit management</h1>

    <p>
      I have put a lot of time into mindfulness recently due to health problems so I am somewhat familiar with the techniques involved. I'm also trying my best to use habit changing techniques to improve my eating, sleeping and work patterns as they have recently become very random which decreases my ability to get stuff done.

      I found the 'Lizard Brain' terminology interesting as I've had a similar thing explained to me using the phrase "The annoying monkey at the back of your head". The way the monkey works is that by personifying our emotions it gives us the ability to treat them like a person, eg. choosing wether they are useful to listen to or not.  Iâ€™ve been finding this a pretty helpful technique to use when I'm getting myself down.

      Whilst learing about mindfulness someone suggested that me being a smoker could give me a good time to be calm. So I am trying to teach myself to use those 5 or so minutes for a quick break to 'Check In' with myself. By this I mean using some mindfulness techniques so when I'm finished I can go back to the rest of my day hopefully feeling calm and I hate this saying but 'in touch with my emotions'. *cringe*

      I am excited to learn throughout this course but also hopfully grow in other ways.
