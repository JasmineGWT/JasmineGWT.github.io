      <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
        <p>
          I would say that their 'relationship' is being the same thing. Kinda like 'command line' and 'terminal', same thing but different names.
        </p>
      <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter. What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
        <p>
          I already journal but recently I have been neglecting to do it on a daily or even weekly basis so I am pretty keen on getting back to it! I always find it really relaxing and I also find that somehow I just start instanly writing about something thats really bothering me which is suprising sometimes since I didn't realize until writng it down that it was effecting me so much. I've found this a really useful practice in terms of 'noticing and accepting' my own emotions.
        </p>
      <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
        <p>
          It comes back to what I wrote about in my first week at EDA about the crazy asshole monkey in the back of your head. The 'monkey' is not nessisarily you talking. It's like sometimes I will shock myself when I think something really offencive or just in general something that don't line up with my values. I just think that my thoughts and feeling aren't always a reflection of me and what I believe. The 'monkey' just comes up with something crazy and you just have to think 'wtf?' to yourself and move on.
